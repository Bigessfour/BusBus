# User Preferences for BusBus Project (Agent Mode)

**General Instructions:**
1. Analyze the project structure and code before making changes.
2. Organize files into logical folders (e.g., UI, Models, Services) and update BusBus.csproj without breaking references.
3. For syntax fixes, check for issues like extra closing braces, using code comments (e.g., // TODO) and OmniSharp diagnostics as guides.
4. Process one task at a time, verifying each change with `dotnet build` to avoid errors.
5. Log all actions in a file named `AgentActionsLog.txt` in the project root, detailing what was changed and why.
6. Pause for user approval in VS Code Edits view before applying changes.
7. Use `github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix` to resolve syntax or reference errors.
8. Protect critical files like AppDbContext.cs, DriverService.cs, and ThemeManager.cs from unintended modifications.
9. Commit changes to git with clear messages like "Organized files" or "Fixed syntax errors." Prioritize accuracy and test thoroughly after each action.

**C# Null-Safety Coding Preferences:**
- Initialize all non-nullable fields and properties in constructors or at declaration.
- Use null-coalescing operators (??) or null-conditional operators (?.) where applicable.
- Add explicit null checks for parameters and return values in methods.
- Verify changes with `dotnet build` to confirm no nullable warnings.
- If warnings persist, suppress only specific cases with `#pragma warning disable` and document the reason.
