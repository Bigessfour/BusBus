# Fix Test Hangs and Enforce Safe Runner

## Problem Description

BusBus tests have been hanging, becoming unresponsive to Ctrl+C, and requiring manual process termination. This issue is blocking development and causing developer frustration.

## Root Causes

1. Tests running without proper timeout enforcement
2. Resource leaks in UI components and database connections
3. Insufficient isolation between test runs
4. Excessive test logging creating resource contention
5. Direct `dotnet test` execution bypassing safety measures

## Solution Approach

We're implementing a comprehensive fix following the workflow:

1. âœ… **Initial Documentation Updates**
   - Updated TEST_SAFETY_MEASURES.md with prominent warnings
   - Updated OPTIMIZATION_CHANGES.md with test safety section
   - Added detailed troubleshooting steps for test hangs

2. ðŸ”„ **Enhanced run-tests-safely.ps1**
   - Added better error handling and GitHub workflow validation
   - Improved warnings about local execution risks
   - Added emergency timeout and process cleanup for local execution

3. ðŸ”„ **Test Environment Verification**
   - Confirming coverlet.runsettings has proper timeout settings
   - Verifying all tests inherit from TestBase with [Timeout(30000)]
   - Checking for isolated test database configuration

4. ðŸ”„ **Verbosity Controls**
   - Implementing BUSBUS_DEBUG_TEST_LOGS and BUSBUS_VERBOSE_DEBUG flags
   - Reducing test log verbosity to prevent resource contention

5. ðŸ”„ **Safe Test Procedures**
   - Documenting the correct way to run tests via GitHub runner
   - Creating process monitoring scripts to detect orphaned processes
   - Establishing workflow for reporting test hangs

## Testing Plan

1. Build the application to verify code integrity
2. Run tests using run-tests-safely.ps1 with different test filters
3. Verify Ctrl+C properly terminates tests when needed
4. Check Task Manager for lingering processes
5. Verify Drivers, Routes, and Vehicles views remain functional

## Success Criteria

- Tests complete without hangs using run-tests-safely.ps1
- Ctrl+C properly interrupts tests when needed
- No manual process termination required
- No more than one .NET process per test run
- Core functionality preserved (Drivers, Routes, Vehicles views)
- Clear, novice-friendly documentation
