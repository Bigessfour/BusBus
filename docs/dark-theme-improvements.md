# Dark Theme Improvements for BusBus Dashboard

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Color Palette Problems**
**Before:** Used very dark, harsh colors that lacked proper contrast
- DarkMainBackground: RGB(33, 37, 41) - Too dark
- DarkCardText: White - Too harsh contrast
- DarkButtonBackground: Green - Wrong color choice for buttons

**After:** Implemented Material Design recommendations
- DarkMainBackground: RGB(18, 18, 18) - Material Design recommended #121212
- DarkCardText: RGB(224, 224, 224) - Softer off-white for better readability
- DarkButtonBackground: RGB(66, 165, 245) - Less saturated blue, more professional

### 2. **Contrast and Accessibility**
**Improvements:**
- Used WCAG-compliant contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Added subtle blue tints to dark grays for better digital screen appearance
- Improved text readability with off-white colors instead of pure white

### 3. **Elevation System**
**Added:** Proper depth perception following Material Design principles
- Implemented `GetElevatedBackground(int elevation)` method
- Higher surfaces get lighter colors to simulate light source
- Added elevation tagging system for panels

### 4. **Theme Application Issues**
**Fixed:**
- Improved ThemeManager to respect panel tags and roles
- Added proper theme change event handling
- Fixed theme toggle button updates
- Added elevation support in theme application

### 5. **Visual Hierarchy**
**Improvements:**
- Better separation between UI elements
- Proper headline panel styling
- Elevated content panels for better depth perception
- Consistent color scheme throughout the application
