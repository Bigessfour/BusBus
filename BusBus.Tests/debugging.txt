Build/test errors encountered:  
CS5001: Program does not contain a static 'Main' method suitable for an entry point [BusBus.csproj]  
This error is expected for class library/test projects if the main project is being built as an executable but lacks a Main method.  
Test project structure and placeholder files are in place.  
  
Next steps:  
Ensure the main project (BusBus.csproj) is set up as a class library if it is not an executable.  
Begin implementing tests in the new structure.
