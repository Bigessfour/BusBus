For all C# code edits, ensure null-safe coding to avoid nullable warnings (e.g., CS8600, CS8618):
- Initialize all non-nullable fields and properties in constructors or at declaration.
- Use null-coalescing operators (??) or null-conditional operators (?.) where applicable.
- Add explicit null checks for parameters and return values in methods.
- Verify changes with `dotnet build` to confirm no nullable warnings.
- If warnings persist, suppress only specific cases with `#pragma warning disable` and document the reason.
