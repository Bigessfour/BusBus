âœ… Self-hosted runner setup complete!

The runner is now:
- Installed at: $WorkFolder
- Running as a Windows service
- Connected to: $GitHubUrl
- Runner name: $RunnerName

To check the runner status:
- Service status: Get-Service -Name "actions.runner.*"
- Runner logs: Get-Content "$WorkFolder\_diag\*.log" -Tail 20

To manage the service:
- Stop: .\svc.cmd stop
- Start: .\svc.cmd start
- Uninstall: .\svc.cmd uninstall

Your workflows can now use 'runs-on: self-hosted' to run on this machine.
