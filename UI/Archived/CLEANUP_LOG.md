### Files Archived
The following files were moved to this archive folder as part of the UI cleanup process:

1. **RouteListPanel.cs.bak** - Backup file, no longer needed
2. **RoutesManagementPanel.cs** - Functionality duplicated by RouteListPanel.cs
3. **VehiclesManagementPanel.cs** - Replaced by VehicleListView.cs
4. **DriversManagementPanel.cs** - Replaced by DriverListView.cs

### Reason for Archival
These files were archived because:
- They contained duplicate functionality
- They were replaced by newer implementations
- They were not referenced in Dashboard.cs
- They were causing build conflicts
